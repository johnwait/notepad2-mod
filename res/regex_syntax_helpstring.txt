             character
    \x##     ASCII char whose code is the hexadecimal value ##h (i.e. 0x##)
             is from \x00 to \xFF
    \###     ASCII char whose code is the octcal value ###o,
             from \000 to \777
    \x{#}    Unicode character by its hexadecimal codepoint value,
             for # => 0 to FFFF
    \a       Bell character, i.e. \x07
  *** \b does NOT match backspace chars, i.e. \x08
    \t       Horizontal tab, i.e. \x09
    \n       Line feed, i.e. \x0A

  Anchors:
    \A ; \Z  Start of text ; End of text
    ^  ; $   Start of a line ; End of a line
    \< ; \>  Start of word ; End of word
    \b ; \B  Word boundary ; Non-w. boundary
    \Q … \E  Escaped sequence of chars, where everything between \Q & \E
             matches literally

  Quantifier:
       matches preceeding...
    ?        0 or 1 time
    *        0 or more times
    +        1 or more times
    {n}      Exactly n times
    {m,n}    Between m & n times (inclusive)
    {,n}     Up to =n times
    ..?      Lazy modifier (does incremental backtracking),
             e.g.:  ??, *?, +? & {m,n}?
    ..+      Possessive modifier (disallows backtracking),
             e.g.:  ?+, *+, ++ & {m,n}+
