Building Notepad2-mod-jrb
-------------------------

In order to compile & build the Notepad2-mod-jrb project from source,
using Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2017 Community is recommended. You will
also need the following build dependencies:

  1) Min GW and MSYS collection of GNU tools;
     - See http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS for details on MinGW
     - Install MinGW by downloading the online package installer from
       http://www.mingw.org/download/installer
     - Packages you should include when installing (from Basic Setup):
       · MSYS Base (msys-base-bin)
       · MSYS Installation for MinGW (mingw-developer-toolkit-bin)
       · Basic MinGW Tools (mingw32-base-bin)
       · GNU C++ Compiler for MinGW (mingw32-gcc-g++-bin)
     - At the end, ensure you have an environment variable MSYS (either
       system or user-specific) that points to the MSYS installation
       root, be it:
       · C:\MinGW\msys\1.0
       · C:\msys\1.0
       · or something else that corresponds to your installation setup.

  2) If the first build errors out saying v141_xp toolset could not be
     found, follow these steps to install it:
     - Open Visual Studio® 2017
     - From the [Tools] menu, select [Get Tools and Features...]
     - On the right pane titled "Installation details", expand the
       set named "Desktop development with C++" and make sure the
       optional package "Windows XP support for C++" is checked.
     - If it isn't checked, tick it and then click on [Modify] to
       update your VS2017 installation.
     - If it is *already* checked, the toolset might be improperly
       installed so untick it, click on [Modify] to update your VS2017
       installation and once done come back to the same place and do
       the opposite to reinstall it.
